# README for Twitter Clone Backend

## Project Overview
The **Twitter Clone Backend** is a RESTful API built using **Node.js** and **Express** that supports the core functionalities of a social media platform similar to Twitter. This backend handles user authentication, tweet creation, liking/disliking tweets, following/unfollowing users, and retrieving user profiles.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For user authentication.
- **Bcrypt.js**: For password hashing.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests from the frontend.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.
- **CORS**: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

## Features
- User registration and login with JWT authentication.
- Create, delete, like, and unlike tweets.
- Follow and unfollow other users.
- Retrieve user profiles and other users.
- Bookmark tweets.
